# AoC2023
Advent of Code 2023 in GO
**There are better solutions out there this my humble approach**
## Day 1 completed
- Very intersting Puzzle learned a lot about string manipulation in GO
- Currently very inefficient a lot of strconv used
- Reversing each line helped find the solution
## Day 2 completed
- Relatively easier than Day1
- Triple nested loop for parsing the input could be improved using regex
- Used Hash maps for both p1 and p2(tracking minimum set of cubes)
